<h1> SIH 2022 </h1>
<body>A multi platform solution in the form of website and a cross platform app which will be both robust and low cost for the government aided schools. The software will be presently usable by three types of users i.e. admin, teacher and the student. The admin will be responsible for addition or removal of teachers and maintenance of the local database. The teacher on the other hand will be able to add student's details and take the necessary attendance of the particular class to which they have been allotted. The students can also use the software to check their attendance and the necessary credentials entered with the school. We also will be making a full fledged cross platform application with with built in OCR(Optical Character Recognition) where the teachers can take the attendance manually on a sheet of paper and then take a snapshot of the sheet which will be passed through the OCR algorithm and the attendance will be automatically updated on the database of the particular class. </body>
